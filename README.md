Matala 1 :

Work process : We got together 4 times.

1st session : We looked for good open source codes , we have found some more difficult some less, 
it wasn't easy to find one which we can edit well.
after a while of research we found a prinston university site, the site contained many possible
 variations for the current situation, they encountered quite the smiliar idea.
the site we used was : http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/44sp/

2nd session : We have picked a code, using dijakstras algorithm and started learning and reading it 
function by function figuring out what each of them do so we can understand what to change.
afterwards we figured out ideas for which would be the easiest to work with, changing the actual code or adding new code lines.
We have decided to change the actual code cause we believed it will lower the running time.

3rd session : we have started working on several ideas and changes using pen and paper, after examining our results we have decided, 
to change a specific code section and decided to make an array that will hold all our black spots.
Then we changed the class that directs the tests to each points, that was after we figured out that dajkstras algorithm had allrdy set an inital
positive infinity to points.

4th session : we finished running the program making fixes and improvment and 
start the testing aswell as finishing it, the run went smooth and the test encountered no bugs
at the end of the session we went over the code again trying to delete certain sections 
that were useless in order to reduce running time of the program.
